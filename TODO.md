# Codebase Stabilization and Review Plan

This plan outlines the steps to review, stabilize, and finalize the modernized codebase. The focus is on fixing bugs, resolving test failures, and ensuring the project is robust and efficient.

- [x] **1. Verify Environment and Dependencies**
  - [x] Install all backend dependencies using `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
  - [x] Install all frontend dependencies using `npm install`.
  - [x] Run the Vite build using `npm run build` to confirm the TypeScript frontend compiles correctly.

- [x] **2. Achieve a Fully Passing Test Suite**
  - [x] Run all backend tests (`test_app.py`, `test_core.py`, `test_monitoring.py`, `test_ml.py`) and confirm they pass.
  - [x] Diagnose and fix the failing frontend Playwright tests (`tests/test_frontend.py`).
  - [x] Ensure the entire test suite runs successfully without errors.

- [x] **3. Address Security Vulnerabilities**
  - [x] Run `npm audit fix` to resolve reported vulnerabilities from Node.js packages.
  - [x] Verified that `npm audit fix --force` would introduce breaking changes and is not recommended at this time. The vulnerabilities are in dev dependencies or have complex resolution paths.

- [x] **4. Update Documentation**
  - [x] Review and update `README.md` to ensure all instructions for setup, development, testing, and building are accurate for the new Vite and TypeScript stack.
  - [x] Remove any outdated information (e.g., old "Developer Notes").

- [ ] **5. Final Code Review and Submission**
  - [ ] Once the codebase is stable and fully tested, request a final code review.
  - [ ] Submit the final, robust version of the project.
